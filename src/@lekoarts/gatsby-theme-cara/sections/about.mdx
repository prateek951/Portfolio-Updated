## About Me
Hi, I'm Prateek Madaan, a Full Stack Developer.
I build scalable,reactive and performant web applications
using my weapons of choice - React, Angular, Vue and Node !

I am a tech-agnostic guy other than programming, I do content-
creation, do code reviews and assist mentor students on
Udemy Platform. I love to travel, work on my fitness, video and
animations are something that I have a deep interest in.
