<ProjectCard title="DatumGuy E-learning Platform" link="https://classroom.datumguy.com/" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)">
 In a team of 4, I worked on some of the core modules of their E-Learning Platform using Angular and CodeIgniter.
 I worked on the learning module, coupons module and the payment system. The e-learning platform was made for their
 flagship Machine Learning Inception Programme where they added the course videos for their content, and manage the progress
 for each of the students enrolled in the course.

<ProjectCard title="Location Visualizer App" link="https://calm-peak-88596.herokuapp.com/" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #ef2fc1 0%, #6094ea 100%)">
  This was more of an analysis problem by working with a dataset. The frontend of the application
  is made using React.js with proper MVC structure implemented on both the frontend and the backend.
  The server is written in Node.js and Express.js. So you can upload the dataset of a certain format
  that adheres to the format of the dataset given in the problem, you will get the required results
  based on the analysis and also the plots for the results. Though I could have use any other library
  for plotting the graphs, I went with Victor.
  It takes a dataset of around 40k trips and filters out the trips based on certain criterias like booking of trips on mobile versus online site bookings and its frequencies, what vehicle model ids does the customers in the point density
  that we plotted does the customers prefer to take etc.
